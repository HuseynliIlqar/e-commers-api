## E-commerce API

This project is an e-commerce API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a robust backend solution for managing products, users, orders, and authentication within an e-commerce platform.

---

### Features

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user management with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and role-based authorization (e.g., admin, user).
* **Product Management:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products, including details like name, description, price, categories, and stock.
* **Order Processing:** Functionality for users to create orders, view their order history, and for administrators to manage order statuses.
* **Shopping Cart:** Users can add and remove items from their cart, which persists across sessions.
* **Category Management:** Organize products into various categories for easier navigation and filtering.
* **Search & Filtering:** Robust search capabilities and filtering options for products based on categories, price ranges, and other attributes.
* **Image Uploads:** Support for uploading product images (likely via a cloud storage service or local file system).
* **Payment Integration (Placeholder):** Designed to be extensible for integrating various payment gateways.
* **Admin Panel (API-driven):** Provides endpoints for administrative tasks such as managing users, products, and orders.

---

### Technologies Used

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
* **Mongoose:** MongoDB object data modeling (ODM) for Node.js.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure authentication and authorization.
* **Bcrypt.js:** For hashing passwords securely.
* **Dotenv:** For loading environment variables.
* **Nodemon:** For automatic server restarts during development.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

* Node.js installed (LTS version recommended)
* MongoDB installed and running, or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HuseynliIlqar/e-commers-api.git
    cd e-commers-api
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file in the root directory** and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ```
    * `PORT`: The port your API will run on.
    * `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce` or your MongoDB Atlas URI).
    * `JWT_SECRET`: A strong, random string used to sign your JWTs.

#### Running the API

* **Development mode (with Nodemon):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
* **Production mode:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The API will be running at `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

### API Endpoints

(A detailed list of API endpoints with their HTTP methods, routes, request bodies, and response structures would typically go here. As I don't have access to the actual code beyond the repository name, this is a placeholder. You would generate this based on your Express routes.)

Example structure:

#### Authentication

* `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
* `POST /api/auth/login` - Log in a user and receive a JWT

#### Users

* `GET /api/users` - Get all users (Admin only)
* `GET /api/users/:id` - Get a single user by ID
* `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update a user by ID
* `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete a user by ID (Admin only)

#### Products

* `GET /api/products` - Get all products
* `GET /api/products/:id` - Get a single product by ID
* `POST /api/products` - Create a new product (Admin only)
* `PUT /api/products/:id` - Update a product by ID (Admin only)
* `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Delete a product by ID (Admin only)
